# Game Auto-Update Shell Scripts
Bash scripts that automatically update game server binaries through local & remote data objects in headless environments.

These scripts assume they're run under the home folder `~` as the working directory.

These scripts have been tested in [Ubuntu Server 18.04 bionic](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04.2/).

### Prerequisites:
* [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/)
