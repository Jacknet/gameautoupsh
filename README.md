# Game Auto-Update Shell Scripts
Bash scripts that automatically update game server binaries in headless environments through links from local & remote data objects.

These scripts assume they're run under the home folder `~` as the working directory and that the username is `ubuntu`.

Tested in [Ubuntu Server 18.04 bionic](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04.2/).

Service files also provided for reference.

### Prerequisites:
